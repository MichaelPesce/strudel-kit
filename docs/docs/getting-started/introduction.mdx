# STRUDEL Kit

Welcome to the STRUDEL Kit Docs! STRUDEL Kit is a web development toolkit for building scientific UIs based on the [STRUDEL Design System and Task Flows](https://strudel.science/design-system/overview/). The toolkit helps users build out scientific Task Flows as usable web applications. It consists of a suite of React-based TypeScript templates and a command line interface for bootstrapping apps using the templates. Apps built with STRUDEL are pre-baked with much of the setup you need to turn complex Task Flows into efficient and highly usable experiences for your users.

Visit [strudel.science](https://strudel.science) for more information about the STRUDEL project.

### Key Features
- Fully customizable React templates for common Task Flows in scientific software
